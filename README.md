# MY IOT PROJECT
Yılmaz Can Yıldızbayrak 

IoT Board Selected: RPi Pico W

IoT Cloud Platform: Blynk cloud

Sensor Selected: Touch Sensor

Wireless Communication Module Selected: HC - 06 

DC Motor Selected (Brushed, Step, Servo): Servo Motor

Application Purpose: This Python code imports libraries, initializes components such as UART, LED pins, and a touch sensor. It connects to Wi-Fi and a Blynk server using an authentication token. A handler is registered for a virtual pin in the Blynk app to control a servo motor based on the received value. The code also reads the touch sensor value to control an LED and receives commands from UART to control other LEDs. It combines hardware control and networking for remote device control and monitoring using the Blynk app.
